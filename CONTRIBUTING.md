# How to contribute to CTF Handbooks

## Making Changes
The content of the handbooks themselves are located under the [`Writerside`](./Writerside) folder. There are two ways you can contribute to these: (1) [Using Writerside](#using-writerside) *(recommended)* and (2) [Without using Writerside](#without-using-writerside).

### Using Writerside
1. Install [JetBrains Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/) (version `2023.3`, build `233.14938`) *OR* [Writerside IDE Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20158-writerside?_gl=1%2All6kto%2A_ga%2ANDc2OTczNjcxLjE3MTIyNDEwNzM.%2A_ga_9J976DJZ68%2AMTcxMjI0ODM2Ny4yLjEuMTcxMjI0ODgwOS40Ny4wLjA.) (version `2024.03.233.14938`) on a compatible JetBrains IDE.

4. Navigate to the Writerside (link to the docs later)
