## Game Freezes on Map Load
* When testing a map, one might encounter the problem of the game freezing upon loading a map.

* For example, after running the command `/ctf_next -f <map_folder>` or clicking "Skip to Map" in the maps catalog, the game freezes and nothing happens. The map will eventually load after several minutes.

* To avoid waiting for that long, vote "1" when you join the world and is asked to vote how many matches of Classes you would like to play. After that, run the `/ctf_next -f <map_folder>` command or skip to your desired map through the maps catalog. Then, you will be asked to vote how many matches of Classic you would like to play. Vote "1" again. This should prevent your game from freezing.
